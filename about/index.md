Code can be confusing.  And every time you come across an interesting project it is almost never commented out for the beginner to intermediate programmer. The purpose of this blog is to sample code from various project in R programming language and dissect each line until we know exactly how it functions.

Some programming knowledge is assumed. If you have never worked in R, I suggest you download R and RStudio and work through problems in the "swirl" package.
