Who am I? I am a graduate candidate in Applied Mathematics based out of Southern California. 

I think one of the best ways to learn good programming is to read other people's code.  My goal here is to walk through as much relevant code as possible and make sure to understand all of the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Then I will annotate all of my findings for you all to read and hopefully comment back. I hope you enjoy the process and learn some things along the way.

Some programming knowledge is assumed. If you have never worked in R, I suggest you download R and RStudio and work through problems in the "swirl" package.
