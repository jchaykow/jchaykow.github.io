Who am I? I run a tutoring business based out of Los Angeles, CA and have recently completed an MS in Mathematics with a focus in applied mathematics from Claremont Graduate University. Data analysis is a passion of mine.

There are two sections of this blog. One is the annotatoR section and the other is My Recent Work.

annotatoR: I think one of the best ways to learn good programming is to read other people's code.  My goal in the annotatoR section is to walk through as much relevant code as possible and make sure to understand all of the who, what, when, where, why, and how. Then I will annotate all of my findings for you all to read and hopefully comment back. I hope you enjoy the process and learn some things along the way.

My Recent Work: I will also add some of the stuff I am currently working on in the My Recent Work section, just in case you are interested (or want to hire me, of course).

Some programming knowledge is assumed. If you have never worked in R, I suggest you download R and RStudio and work through problems in the ["swirl"](http://swirlstats.com/) package.
